# datascale

Functions for automatic scaling of matplotlib plot axes/resolution to data

## plotdatasize()

Scale line width or marker width (for line plots and scatter plots) to correspond directly to the scale of data on either/both plot axes.

## plotdatadpi()

Scale dpi of output image (when saving figure) to produce a certain number of pixels per data unit on either/both plot axis/axes. Useful for plots that need a certain amount of detail per axis unit (e.g. geographic projections).
